## Quick introduction

My name is Roger. 

I'm a developer relations engineer at Google, specifically Google Cloud.

What even is developer relations? Depends who you ask. 

If you ask me, the job of a developer relations engineer is to be the liason between a technical product, platform or service, and the community of developers who use it. We help the developer find success with the platform, and help the platform improve for the developer.  I'll leave it at that for now.  

I started at Google in 2016 through their (now defunct) IT Residency Program where I had the opportunity to work as a field tech in their world famous **TechStops** (also now defunct). After that I pivoted to system administration for Google's hardware product area, and then landed in developer relations in 2019. 

And here I am.

Since joining developer relations, I've done mostly internal devrel work, but you can catch me some of the [video content I've contributed to on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=google+cloud+roger+martinez&sp=CAMSAhAB) or some written content on my [Medium page](https://medium.com/@roger-that-dev). I'm planning to use this space as a central hub for any future content, and to share any other thoughts, insights, or projects I'm working on.

I said it'd be quick so let's leave it there. More soon.
