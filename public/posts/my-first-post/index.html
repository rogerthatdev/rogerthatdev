My name is Roger.
I&rsquo;m a developer relations engineer at Google, specifically Google Cloud.
What even is developer relations? Depends who you ask.
If you ask me, the job of a developer relations engineer is to be the liason between a technical product, platform or service, and the community of developers who use it. We help the developer find success with the platform, and help the platform improve for the developer.  I&rsquo;ll leave it at that for now.">

<p>My name is Roger.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m a developer relations engineer at Google, specifically Google Cloud.</p>
<p>What even is developer relations? Depends who you ask.</p>
<p>If you ask me, the job of a developer relations engineer is to be the liason between a technical product, platform or service, and the community of developers who use it. We help the developer find success with the platform, and help the platform improve for the developer.  I&rsquo;ll leave it at that for now.</p>
<p>I started at Google in 2016 through their (now defunct) IT Residency Program where I had the opportunity to work as a field tech in their world famous <strong>TechStops</strong> (also now defunct). After that I pivoted to system administration for Google&rsquo;s hardware product area, and then landed in developer relations in 2019.</p>
<p>And here I am.</p>
<p>Since joining developer relations, I&rsquo;ve done mostly internal devrel work, but you can catch me some of the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=google+cloud+roger+martinez&amp;sp=CAMSAhAB">video content I&rsquo;ve contributed to on YouTube</a> or some written content on my <a href="https://medium.com/@roger-that-dev">Medium page</a>. I&rsquo;m planning to use this space as a central hub for any future content, and to share any other thoughts, insights, or projects I&rsquo;m working on.</p>
<p>I said it&rsquo;d be quick so let&rsquo;s leave it there. More soon.</p>
