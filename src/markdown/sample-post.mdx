# JavaScript Closures Explained

Closures are a powerful and often confusing feature of JavaScript. In simple terms, a **closure** is when a function *remembers* variables from its outer scope, even after that outer function has returned.

> Closures let you access outer function variables from an inner function.

## Basic Example

Consider this:

`function outer() { let count = 0; return function inner() { count++; return count; }; }`

Then calling:

`const counter = outer();`

`counter(); // 1`

`counter(); // 2`

This works because the inner function "closes over" the variable `count`.

## When Are Closures Useful?

Closures are useful for:

- Maintaining private state  
- Function factories  
- Event handlers  
- Partial application  

Here's another example:

`function makeMultiplier(x) { return function(y) { return x * y; }; }`

`const double = makeMultiplier(2);`

`double(5); // 10`

## Inline Code

Closures are formed when a function accesses a variable defined outside its immediate scope, like `x` in the above example.

## Tips



## Comparison Table

| Use Case         | Needs Closure | Example                          |
|------------------|---------------|----------------------------------|
| Private state     | ✅            | Counter functions                |
| One-time config   | ✅            | Custom loggers                   |
| API callback      | ❌            | Fetching data                    |

## Conclusion

Closures are a core part of JavaScript and essential for writing expressive, powerful functions.
