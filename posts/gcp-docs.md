# Untitled GCP documentation guide

Google Cloud is a gigantic platform. It can used by the biggest companies or by the most solo dolo developer. It's continously changing and improving all the time. Given this wide breadth, it's no easy feat making sure the documentation is updated and useful. But it's a lot for anyone to navigate through. This article will try to break down Google Cloud documentation to help you get whatever it is you might be looking for.

## Google Cloud Documentation site

As a Cloud platform, GCP's total documentation is massive. They've got pages for products you probably never even heard of. That said, the landing page is pretty broad and not very intutitive for finding what you might be looking. I'd recommend skipping the maing documenation page and instead choosing from the following pages, depending on what you're looking for. 

This is a catch all, but not neccessarily a great starting point. 

### Developer documentation by language

### Documentation by product

### Asset search

Sprinkled thoughout the site are different resources for learning the ins and outs of Google Cloud: Quickstarts, code samples, tutorials, guides.  You could stumble on these while browsing but if you what you want and just need to find it for a particular product, here are some useful search pages for you to book mark.

**Code sample search**
Find code samples for any product, service or use case. The results will take you to the documentation that contains it, so you'll get context around the purpose.

**Quickstart and tutorial search**
Quickstarts are meant to offer step-by-step tutorials that cover basic use cases for a given product.
